Create the pubs database

🏆 C H A L L E N G E 🏆

Write a single query using (any) table or tables in the pubs database. 

The query should last for at least 15 seconds, but not longer than 45 seconds.

You can create objects which your query calls, but please keep them in the pubs database and keep your script as short as possible (not 6000 lines 🙃)


SOME RULES:
* Your query can't change the data in the pubs database, or do anything outside the pubs database
* No changing system settings (max server memory, etc) 
* Other queries should still be able to connect to the SQL Server instance and get started, but should have lock waits 
    (in other words, a causing a BSOD or using all the threads ain't the challenge, LOL)

TIPS:
* Start simple
* Get more creative from there
* Submit your code within 10 minutes, tweet a link to it with #BestWorstCode
